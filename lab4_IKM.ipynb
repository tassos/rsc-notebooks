    "In the previous works we analysed the problem of calculating the position and orientation of a Cartesian system attached on the end-effector, when the robot coordinates of each joint of the robot is known. This exercise proposes \n",
    "an approach a bit more difficult: we want to determine the joint coordinates for a specific position of the end-effector. In other words, determine a set of coordinates of the robot $q_1,q_2,...,q_n$, that ensure a specific position and orientation of the end-effector. This problem is known as the __inverse geometric model__ of a kinematic chain. The main objective of this exercise is the description of a heuristic method for determining this inverse geometric model of a robotic arm and to apply this method in two robotic kinematic structures."

    "The problem of determining the inverse geometric model of a robot is a non-linear problem. For a robotic structure, we are starting with the numerical values of the matrix that describes the direct geometric model ($^0T_N$) and we aim at determining the set of joint coordinates of the robot ($q_1,q_2,...q_n$). For a robot with 6 degrees of freedom (6 motor joints), we obtain a system with 12 equations and 6 unknowns. However, from the 9 equations that result from the correspondence of the orientation from matrix $^T_6$, only three of them are independent and the other 6 are redundant. This limits us to the determination of maximum 3 independent variables. If, on these three equations, we add the three equations resulting from the correspondence of the position vectors from matrix $^T_6$, we obtain a set of 6 independent equations that allow us to determine a maximum of 6 independent variables. These variables are corresponding to the 6 degrees of freedom of the robot. This system of equations is non-linear and transcendent, often proving difficult to solve. Like all non-linear systems of equations, the main problems are raised by the existence of solutions, existence of multiple solutions and the method to use for solving the system."

    "We need to determine the inverse geometric model since the trajectories of the robotic arm are described in Cartesian coordinates, while the robot is driven by the motor joints and is therefore described in the joint coordinates. The inverse geometric model is determined based either on the direct geometric model, on heuristic methods (e.g. for simple structures), on iterative methods (e.g. for more complicated structures), or on geometric methods. It is possible to determine either the particular solution of a model or a general method (analytic) solution thereof. Applying heuristic methods is convenient but does not guarantee a unique solution. Thus, two people who use this method to solve the same problem can reach a different solution (although equivalent)."

You learned how using the forward kinematics we can have joints' position as inputs and the end-effector position as output. The first example shows that dependency. The second example has as input the end-effector final position and shows how the joints should be positioned. Can you use the whole range?\n"
