    "*Kinematics* is the domain that studies motion without taking into consideration forces that generate the respective motion. The study of kinematics analyses the positions, velocities, accelerations and derivatives of higher order of the position (derivatives in respect to time or other variables). The study of kinematics of a robotic arm implies studying the geometric and temporal properties of a motion.\n",

    "The study of the geometry of a robotic arm, implies the attachment of a coordinate system on the different parts that constitute the arm. Once this is done, we can study the relationship between these coordinate systems to define the position and orientation of the end effector. However, when the geometry of the robot arm is not a trivial one, the position and orientation of these coordinate systems is difficult to determine in a repetitive way. This laboratory exercise presents a method to determine the position and orientation of the end-effector in respect to the reference frame, as a function of variables that are related to each segment of the arm. This model is an alternative method for calculating the direct geometric model of a robot."

The bodies are called **links** and a **joint** connects two subsequent links together. From a mechanical design perspective, the majority of the joints implement a single degree of freedom, whether we are referring to translational or rotational joints. In the rare cases that a mechanism constitutes a joint with *n degrees of freedom*, this can be modelled as a series of *n joints with one degree of freedom, connected on n-1 links of length zero*."

For the purpose of obtaining the geometric model, a link can be considered as a rigid solid that defines a relationship between two adjacent joints (distal and proximal). The axis of a joint is defined as axis around which link $i$ rotates in relation to link $i-1$. For each two axes in space, the distance between them can be measured based on the common perpendicular. This common perpendicular exists always, and it is unique, except in the case of two parallel axes. In this case, there are infinite common perpendiculars but their length is always the same."
