    "# Coordinate systems. Geometrical transformations\n",

    "One of the fundamental necessities in robotics is the localisation of objects in three dimensional space. These objects can be elements that compose the physical structure of a robot, parts and components that the robots manipulate, tools or in general any body that exists in the space of operation of the robot. These objects can be described fundamentally with roughly two attributes: their position and orientation. This information is what we call the _Pose_ of an object. An immediate aspect of interest would be how to represent these and, furthermore, how can we manipulate mathematically these properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the description of position and orientation of a solid in space, we will attach a rigid Cartesian coordinate system on it. Since any coordinate system can serve as a reference system on which we can express the position and orientation of a body, there is the question of how to change or transform these attributes of a body from a Cartesian system of reference to another one. This exercise presents conventions and methodology for the description of positions and orientations, as well as the mathematical formalisation that is used for the manipulation of these quantities in several coordinate systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The manipulation using a robot assumes the fact that objects and tools will be displaced in space with the use of a mechanism. This fact determines the need to represent the position and orientation of such objects that we want to manipulate as well as the position of the mechanism of manipulation. To define and manipulate mathematically the quantities that represent the position and orientation it is necessary to define a coordinate system and the corresponding conventions used for their representation."

    "In robotics, the _standard_ Cartesian system is obtained through the application of the rule of the right hand. The thumb of the right hand indicates the positive direction of the X axis, the index finger indicates the positive direction for the Y axis, and the middle finger indicates the positive direction of the Z axis.  For the definition of positive directions of rotations, we use again the rule of the right hand. When the thumb is pointing the positive direction of an axis, the rest of the fingers indicate the positive rotation around that axis.\n",

    "The position of a point can be described using the Cartesian coordinates of an object expressed relative to the origin of a coordinate system $(x_1,y_1,z_1)$ or through a vector of position $p_1$. For example, the position of a parallelepiped\n",
    "in a coordinate system can be described using 8 position vectors, one for each one of the vertices. In the case that the object is moving, the calculation of the new position assumes the calculation of a new set of 8 vectors of position. This situation can become even more complicated if we are talking about irregular objects (a particular case, when for each position of the object it might be necessary to calculate more than 8 vector of position), or in the case in which we have more objects that move independently in relation to each other. An alternative and more efficient solution is to attach a different coordinate system on each object, which will displace together with the object itself. If the object is rigid (i.e. it does not deform), the position of every point belonging to the object remains the same in respect to the coordinate system attached on the object, independent of its the displacement. In this way, the problem of calculating the motion of an object is reduced to the calculation of the relation between two coordinate systems (reference system and the coordinate system attached on the object). Moreover, this relationship allows the calculation of the new position of any point belonging to the object of interest. The position of point $P$ is described by its Cartesian coordinates: $P(x,y,z)$."
