However, one of the most relevant tasks for a robotic system is to be able to plan its trajectory over time. This is important for two reasons: a) it gives us a way to control the velocity of the robot along a specific path b) it allows us to develop obstacle avoidance algorithms.\n",

    "Controlling each individual joint is not by itself very useful, as we are usually interested to control the end-effector pose. As we know from inverse kinematics we can calculate the joint coordinates required to achieve a certain pose, depending always on the degrees of freedom of our robotic arm. Therefore, if we can calculate a trajectory for the end-effector, then we can calculate the required joint coordinates for achieving the trajectory using inverse kinematics. In order to produce once again smooth transitions in pose, we will need to interpolate from a starting to an ending position. We will decompose the interpolation of pose into two parts: position and orientation\n",

    "Interpolating the position is rather straight-forward, as we can interpolate each one of the components of the position vector ($X$, $Y$, and $Z$ coordinates) from the beginning to the end-position. If we want to ensure smooth motion without jerk, we should once again apply a polynomial interpolation to each coordinate individually.\n",
